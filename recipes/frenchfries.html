    <h1>French fries recipe</h1>
    <p>French fries all'assassina, or assassin's French fries, are inspired by one of Italy's most unusual and delicious pasta recipes, spaghetti all'assassina. Intensely savory from caramelized tomato paste and cheese, with a sweet and sour note followed by a building, spicy heat from cayenne and pepper flakes, these fries are the complete opposite of one-note.</p>
    <h2>What we need in order to make the most <strong>delicious</strong>french fries:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely crushed or minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>16 ounces frozen crinkle cut French fries</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh Italian parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now that we have the ingredients we can get <strong>coockin'</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste, olive oil, crushed garlic, granulated garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne, black pepper, and salt to a large mixing bowl, and whisk thoroughly to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the fries in using your hands, a few at a time; make sure fries are all separated, and no ice goes into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Toss gently with a spatula until every fry is completely and evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Use a microplane or other very fine grater to grate a dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top of the fries. Toss with spatula until evenly mixed in, and then repeat for a total of 2 grated cheese additions.</li>
        <li>Transfer fries to the prepared baking sheet in a single, even layer; space out as evenly as possible. Grate Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top until every fry is covered.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the fries are very well browned, charred in spots, and the edges of the fries have crisped up, 30 to 35 minutes. Depending on the size and shape of your frozen fries, you may need to bake longer, but start checking at 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Grated additional Parmigiano-Reggiano over fries, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
